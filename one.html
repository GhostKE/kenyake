<p>In this article, we are about to share some of the best CMD commands that are widely used for Hacking purposes. <br>So, let’s check out the list of best CMD commands for Windows 10 computers.<br>
<h2>1. ping</h2><br>

</div>

This command uses your internet connection in order to send some packets of data to a specific web address then these packets are sent back to your PC. The test simply shows the amount of time it took to reach the specific address. In simple words, it helps you to know if the host you are pinging is alive.<br>
You can use the Ping command whenever you need to verify that the host computer can connect to the TCP/IP network and its resources.<br>
For example, you can type in Command prompt ping 8.8.8.8, which belongs to Google.<br>
You can replace “8.8.8.8” with “www.google.com” or something else which you want to ping.<br>
<h2>2. nslookup</h2><br>

nslookup www.google.com (Replace Google.com with your website URL of which you want to find the IP address)<br>
<h2>3. tracert </h2>

<br><h2>4. arp</h2>

This command opens up an entire task manager on the command prompt. Users just need to enter the tasklist on CMD and they will see the list of all running processes. You can figure out all the wrongs with these commands.<br>
Moreover, the command can also be used when you need to forcefully close any process. For example, if you want to kill PID 1532 process then you can enter the command:<br>

Well, pathping command is pretty much similar to the tracert, but it shows more detailed information. The commands take a few moments to complete as it analyzes the route taken and computes packet loss. On Windows command prompt, just type in the following command<br>
pathping techviral.net (Replace techviral.net with the one that you want to ping)<br>
So, above are the 15 best CMD commands used in hacking. You can actually explore a lot more than this, we have listed the Best CMD commands in one of our articles! I hope you like the post! Share it with your friends too. Leave a comment below if you want to add any command to the list.<br>
